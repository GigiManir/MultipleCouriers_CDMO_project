# MiniZinc Tutorial

## Step 1: Install MiniZinc
1. Go to the [MiniZinc download page](https://www.minizinc.org/software.html).
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

## Step 2: Create a MiniZinc Model
Create a file named `example_model.mzn` with the following content. This example model solves a simple assignment problem where we assign tasks to workers such that the total cost is minimized.

    ```minizinc
    int: n; % number of tasks/workers
    array[1..n, 1..n] of int: cost; % cost matrix

    array[1..n] of var 1..n: assignment; % task assignment

    constraint
        forall(i in 1..n) (
            count(assignment, i) == 1 % each task is assigned to exactly one worker
        );

    var int: total_cost = sum(i in 1..n)(cost[i, assignment[i]]);

    solve minimize total_cost;

## Step 3: Create a Data File
## Create a file named example_data.dzn with the following content. This file provides specific values for the parameters defined in the model.

## Step 4: Run the Model with the Data File
Using MiniZinc IDE
Open the MiniZinc IDE.
Load your model file (example_model.mzn).
Load your data file (example_data.dzn).
Click the "Solve" button to run the model with the provided data. The IDE will display the results.
Using Command Line
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing your model and data files.

Run the following command:

    minizinc --solver Gecode example_model.mzn example_data.dzn

Replace Gecode with your preferred solver if you have another one installed.

Example Output
The output will display the optimal assignment of tasks to workers and the total cost. For example:

    assignment = array1d(1..3, [2, 3, 1]);
    total_cost = 10;

This output indicates that the optimal assignment has task 1 assigned to worker 2, task 2 assigned to worker 3, and task 3 assigned to worker 1, with a total cost of 10.

Additional Tips
Multiple Data Files: If you have multiple instances, create separate .dzn files for each instance and run the model for each data file individually.
Debugging: If your model does not behave as expected, use the MiniZinc IDE's debugging features to inspect variable values and constraint satisfaction.
Advanced Features: Explore MiniZinc's advanced features like parameterized models, custom search strategies, and output annotations for more complex problems.
By following these steps, you can successfully run MiniZinc models on various problem instances. ```
