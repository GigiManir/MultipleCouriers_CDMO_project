Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) with Python using z3
Install z3:

sh
Copia codice
pip install z3-solver
Create and Solve an SMT Model:
Let's solve a simple SMT problem involving integer arithmetic.

python
Copia codice
from z3 import Solver, Int, And, Or, sat

# Create a solver instance
solver = Solver()

# Create integer variables
x = Int('x')
y = Int('y')

# Add constraints (example: x + y = 5 and x > y)
solver.add(x + y == 5)
solver.add(x > y)

# Check if the problem is satisfiable
if solver.check() == sat:
    print("SATISFIABLE")
    model = solver.model()
    print(f"x: {model[x]}")
    print(f"y: {model[y]}")
else:
    print("UNSATISFIABLE")
These examples provide a basic introduction to using mip for mixed-integer programming and z3 for both SAT and SMT problems. You can expand these examples to solve more complex problems by adding additional variables, constraints, and objectives as needed.
